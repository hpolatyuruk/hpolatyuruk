Hi. I'm Huseyin.

I am a Sr. Software Engineer having 10+ years of experience in consumer/enterprise software development and team management. I've mostly developed web and cloud applications and I've also participated in developing desktop applications as well. 

After years of active coding and development experience, Iâ€™ve been in leadership positions as well where I have gained experience in managing teams, but most importantly I was able to share my experiences with them, so together we grow and learn from each other. 

The web is my expertise area which I'm passionate about. Although I prefer building backend applications, I'm qualified to develop a front-end application as well and ready to take responsibility for that position.
